# Flux of energy for nonspinning compact binaries on elliptic orbits

The file ``flux.txt`` contains the flux of energy for nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits.

## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``x`` is the dimensionless frequency of the (2,2) mode of the GW
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio
* ``et`` is the time-eccentricity from the quasi-Keplerian parametrization

We also introduce the following *enhancement functions* defined in (6.1) of arXiv:0711.0250v2:
* ``\[CurlyPhi][et]`` is defined as $\varphi(e_t) = \frac{13696}{8191} \sum_{p=0}^\infty - \frac{16403*20}{24573*49209}$
* ``\[Psi][et]`` is defined as $\psi(e_t) = \sum_{p=0}^\infty$
*  ``\[Zeta][et]`` is defined as $\zeta(e_t) = \sum_{p=0}^\infty$
*  ``\[Kappa][et]`` is defined as $\kappa(e_t) = \sum_{p=0}^\infty$

The result is given at 4.5PN accuracy.
