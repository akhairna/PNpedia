# Flux of energy for nonspinning compact binaries on elliptic orbits

The file ``flux.txt`` contains the flux of energy for nonspinning compact binaries on circular orbits.

## Notations

We use the following notations:
* ``G`` is Newton's constant of gravitation
* ``c`` is the speed of light
* ``x`` is the dimensionless frequency of the (2,2) mode of the GW
* ``\[Nu]`` is the symmetric mass ratio
* ``et`` is the time-eccentricity from the quasi-Keplerian parametrization

We also introduce the following *enhancement functions* defined in (6.1) of arXiv:0711.0250v2:
* ``\[CurlyPhi][et]`` is defined as $\varphi(e_t)$
* ``\[Psi][et]`` is defined as $\psi(e_t) = \frac{13696}{8191}\alpha(e_t) - \frac{16403}{24573}\beta(e_t) - \frac{112}{24573}\gamma(e_t)$
*  ``\[Zeta][et]`` is defined as $\zeta(e_t) = -\frac{1424}{4081}\theta(e_t) + \frac{16403}{12243}\beta(e_t) + \frac{16}{1749}\gamma(e_t)$
*  ``\[Kappa][et]`` is defined as $\kappa(e_t) = \frac{1}{(1-e_t^2)^{13/2}}\left(1 + \frac{85}{6}e_t^2 + \frac{5171}{192} e_t^4 + \frac{1751}{192}e_t^6 + \frac{297}{1024} e_t^8\right)+ \frac{59920}{116761} \chi(e_t)

The result is given at 4.5PN accuracy.
